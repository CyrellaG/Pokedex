## Project Description: 

### What does your project do? 
This assignment is to practice and cement my knowledge of **Asynchronous Programming & API**. This pokedex app fetch pokemon data from https://pokeapi.co/ which is an API that provides ***"information on Pok√©mon, their moves, abilities, types, egg groups and much, much more."***

When the users search a pokemon name, the following information will be rendered to the page: 
- Species Name
- A Picture / Sprite 
- Type Name(s)
- Weight
- Height
- Base Experience


### Try it out! 
To try this program out, you can do the following:  
- In the search bar, enter the pokemon species name of your choice and hit the search button.
- Visit the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Pok%C3%A9mon#:~:text=List%20of%20Pok%C3%A9mon%20species%20names%20by%20generation" target="_blank">Wikipedia - Pokemon List</a> to see all 1,008 pokemon species names.
